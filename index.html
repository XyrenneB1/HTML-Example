<h1>Minecarft - The High Selling Vidoe Game of All Time</h1>
 <p>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game — meaning it gives players a procedurally generated, virtually limitless world made of blocky “voxels” where they can mine resources, craft items, build structures, explore, and survive.</p>
Some of its features are:
<p>•	Creative Mode: Unlimited blocks and freedom to build anything.</p>
<p>•	Survival Mode: Players gather resources and face monsters.</p>
<p>•	Multiplayer: Join friends or communities online.</p>
•	Modding & Custom Content: Powerful community tools and mods.
•	Educational Use: Used in schools for subjects like math and design. 

<h2>Creator of Minecarft</h2>
<p>Markus Persson, often called “Notch,” is a Swedish programmer who originally created Minecraft in 2009. He developed the game’s core mechanics and early versions himself, and it quickly grew from a small indie project into a global hit.
•	Notch released the first public version on May 17, 2009, and the official 1.0 full release on November 18, 2011. 
•	He co-founded Mojang Studios, the original developer of Minecraft. 
•	In 2014, Notch sold Mojang and the Minecraft IP to Microsoft for about $2.5 billion USD and stepped away from development. 
After his departure, lead development passed to Jens “Jeb” Bergensten and Mojang’s internal team. The game has continued to grow with major updates and new features released regularly.
