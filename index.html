<h1>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game — meaning it gives players a procedurally generated, virtually limitless world made of blocky “voxels” where they can mine resources, craft items, build structures, explore, and survive.
Some of its features are:
•	Creative Mode: Unlimited blocks and freedom to build anything.
•	Survival Mode: Players gather resources and face monsters.
•	Multiplayer: Join friends or communities online.
•	Modding & Custom Content: Powerful community tools and mods.
•	Educational Use: Used in schools for subjects like math and design.
